# Glint BRDF Pytorch Reimplementation

_The texts below are from [Deliot et al.](https://thomasdeliot.wixsite.com/blog/single-post/hpg23-real-time-rendering-of-glinty-appearance-using-distributed-binomial-laws-on-anisotropic-grids)'s source code._

The source code contains two parts:

- An HLSL file to include in your rendering shader, that contains the Glinty NDF function to call during your light loop.
- A C# script combined with a shader file to generate the small precomputed texture of packed random numbers that we use to speed up performance. Since we compute this texture on the GPU, it takes only a few milliseconds and only needs to be run once. We provide this as a Unity specific implementation, but the code is short and easy to port to other frameworks.

To use the Glinty NDF, simply replace the NDF evaluation in your code with a call to the `SampleGlints2023NDF` method. The input parameters are the following:

- `localHalfVector`: the half vector in tangent space
- `targetNDF`: the target NDF energy D(h)
- `maxNDF`: the maximum possible NDF energy D(0) (when the local half vector's slope is null)
- `uv`: the UV texture coordinates
- `duvdx`, `duvdy`: the screen-space derivatives of UV

The include file additionally defines the following constant parameters that need to be sent to the shader:

- `_Glint2023NoiseMap`: the precomputed texture of random numbers to bind
- `_Glint2023NoiseMapSize`: the width of the precomputed texture of random numbers (the texture is assumed to be square)
- `_ScreenSpaceScale`: the minimal allowed size of a glint in pixels. Due to Shannon's sampling theorem, using 1 here results in aliasing. We recommend using 1.5
- `_LogMicrofacetDensity`: the (log) amount of microfacets per unit surface texture space area
- `_MicrofacetRoughness`: the ad-hoc R ratio parameter in our paper, simulating a microfacet roughness parameter
- `_DensityRandomization`: the amount of randomization of glint densities across the surface
